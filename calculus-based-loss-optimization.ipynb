    "Problem 1.3: Introducing Cost Functions - Fence Optimization (20 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "A farmer wants to build a rectangular fence to enclose exactly 1 acre of land (43,560 ft²). Fencing costs $8 per foot. The farmer wants to minimize the total fencing cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the area must be exactly 1 acre, if we choose the length L in feet, then the width W is determined by: W = 43,560/L\n",

    "    What do you notice about the relationship between the optimal length and width?\n",

    "Note for Students: This introduces the idea of a cost or loss function that we want to minimize. Here, our cost function C(L) represents the total expense we want to minimize, subject to the constraint that we must enclose exactly 1 acre. In machine learning, we'll minimize functions that represent how \"bad\" our model's predictions are. As the model learns, the predictions will get less bad.\n",

    "Don't use an LLM! Homework is graded based on a good faith effort (not for correctness) so there's no value to getting a perfect answer from an LLM. The goal of this is for you to gain personal understanding of how to code gradient descent. Using an LLM will hurt you because you will be expected to write this code (or very similar) on a test/quiz.\n",
